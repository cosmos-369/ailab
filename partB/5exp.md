### **Explanation of the N-Queens Problem Solution**

This program is a solution to the **N-Queens Problem**, where the objective is to place `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. Specifically, no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.

The program uses a **backtracking approach** to explore all possible placements of queens on the board and identifies all valid configurations.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Program**

#### **1. Function `is_safe(board, row, col)`**

This function checks whether it's safe to place a queen at a given position `(row, col)` on the board.

- **Input**: `board` (list representing the board), `row` (the row to place the queen), and `col` (the column to place the queen).
- **Output**: `True` if placing a queen at `(row, col)` is safe; `False` otherwise.

#### **Safety Checks**:

1. **Vertical Check**: Ensures that no other queen exists in the same column (`col`).
   - For each row `i` above the current row, check if any queen is already placed in the column `col` (i.e., `board[i] == col`). If a queen is found, return `False`.
2. **Diagonal Check**: Ensures that no other queen exists on the diagonals.
   - For each row `i` above the current row, the absolute difference between the current row (`i`) and the target row (`row`) should be equal to the absolute difference between the column positions (`board[i] - col`). If this condition is met, a queen is present on the diagonal, so return `False`.

If no conflicts are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that placing a queen at `(row, col)` is safe.

#### **2. Function `solve_n_queen(board, row)`**

This function attempts to place queens on the board row by row using **backtracking**. If a valid configuration is found (i.e., all queens are placed safely), the function adds the configuration to the list of solutions.

- **Input**: `board` (list representing the board), `row` (current row to place the queen).
- **Output**: A list of solutions (each solution is a valid configuration of queens on the board).

#### **Backtracking Logic**:

1. **Base Case**: When `row == len(board)`, it means a valid solution has been found (all rows have queens placed). The function returns a list containing a copy of the current board (`[board[:]]`).
2. **Recursive Case**: For each column `col` in the current row (`row`):
   - If placing a queen at `(row, col)` is safe (checked by `is_safe` function), place the queen by setting `board[row] = col`.
   - Recursively attempt to place queens in the next row (`row + 1`).
   - After exploring this option, **backtrack** by resetting `board[row] = -1` (removing the queen).
3. **Collect Solutions**: The function collects solutions recursively by extending the `solutions` list with the results from the recursive calls.

Finally, it returns the list `solutions`, which contains all valid configurations of queens.

#### **3. Function `print_solution(solution)`**

This function prints a given solution in a human-readable format. The solution is a list where each element represents the column position of a queen in a given row.

- **Input**: `solution` (a list representing the positions of queens).
- **Output**: Prints the chessboard with queens represented as `"Q"` and empty spaces as `"."`.

For each row:

- If the queen is placed in column `i`, print `"Q"`.
- Otherwise, print `"."`.

A new line is printed after each row.

#### **4. Main Program**

1. **Initialize the Board**:
   - `board = [-1] * n` creates a board of size `n x n` initialized with `-1`, indicating that no queens are placed yet.
2. **Solve the N-Queens Problem**:

   - The function `solve_n_queen(board, 0)` starts solving the problem by placing queens starting from row 0.

3. **Print the Result**:
   - After finding all solutions, the program prints the total number of solutions for the 8-Queens problem.
   - If any solutions are found, it prints one of the solutions using the `print_solution` function.

### **Example Output for 8-Queens Problem**

```plaintext
Found 92 solutions for the 8-Queens problem.

One of the solutions:
. Q . . . . . .
. . . Q . . . .
. . . . . Q . .
Q . . . . . . .
. . . . Q . . .
. . . . . . Q .
. Q . . . . . .
. . Q . . . . .
```

This represents one valid solution where:

- The first queen is placed in the second column of the first row (`. Q . . . . . .`).
- The second queen is placed in the fourth column of the second row (`. . . Q . . . .`).
- And so on for the rest of the rows.

### **Time Complexity and Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**: In the worst case, the algorithm explores all possible configurations of queens on the board. The time complexity is **O(N!)**, where `N` is the number of queens (or the size of the board).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(N)**, as the board is represented by a list of size `N`, and each recursive call maintains a stack of function calls.

---

### **Summary**

- **Backtracking** is used to explore all possible ways to place queens on the board.
- The `is_safe` function ensures that queens don't threaten each other.
- The `solve_n_queen` function recursively tries different positions for queens and backtracks if a configuration is invalid.
- The program finds all possible valid configurations and prints one of them in a readable format.
